        """Background
Academic writing is an essential component of research, characterized by structured expression of ideas, data-driven arguments, and logical reasoning. However, it poses challenges such as handling vast amounts of information and complex ideas. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into academic writing has become increasingly important, offering solutions to these challenges. This review aims to explore specific domains where AI significantly supports academic writing.
Methods
A systematic review of literature from databases like PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, published since 2019, was conducted. Studies were included based on relevance to AI's application in academic writing and research, focusing on writing assistance, grammar improvement, structure optimization, and other related aspects.
Results
The search identified 24 studies through which six core domains were identified where AI helps academic writing and research: 1) facilitating idea generation and research design, 2) improving content and structuring, 3) supporting literature review and synthesis, 4) enhancing data management and analysis, 5) supporting editing, review, and publishing, and 6) assisting in communication, outreach, and ethical compliance. ChatGPT has shown substantial potential in these areas, though challenges like maintaining academic integrity and balancing AI use with human insight remain.""",
    """We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost.""",
